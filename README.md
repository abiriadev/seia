## :sparkles: Key Features

-   **[React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components)** support: Renders ahead of time on the server and streams HTML to the client for improved performance.
-   Unlike [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) which works only with Webpack-compatible bundlers, Seia adopts **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev)** for faster development and better compatibility with a great ecosystem.
-   **Zero configuration and scaffolding**: No more `npx create-whatever-app`. Start a new project in seconds without any setup or scaffolding required.
-   **Minimal client bundle size**: Reduces the client bundle size to a minimum at build time, requiring only three files to hydrate on the client.
-   **Freedom to choose your tools**: Seia does not force you to use specific routing, data fetching, or state management solutions. Use your favorite tools.
-   **TypeScript support**: Comes with type-safe API and hooks out of the box, but allows you to use JavaScript if you prefer.
-   **Deploy anywhere**: Deploy your SSR server to Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Workers and anywhere [Hono](https://hono.dev) supports.

## :rocket: Quickstart

We provide the `create-seia-app` wizard to help you get your new project up and running quickly

```sh
$ npm create seia-app # yarn create seia-app or pnpm create seia-app
```

After running the command, it will start to ask you a few questions. Choose the options that best suit your needs. Once you've made your selections, a new project will be created with the specified settings.

Navigate into your newly created project directory and install the dependencies. After that, build your project using the following command:

```sh
$ npm run build # yarn build or pnpm build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the server and client bundles. To start the SSR server, use:


```sh
$ npm start # yarn start or pnpm start
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the server running at http://localhost:5314.

## :zap: Migrate from Vite

If you already have a Vite project and want to migrate it to Seia, follow these steps.

First, install Seia as a dependency to your project:

```sh
$ npm install seia.js
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Seia currently requires `react` and `react-dom` as peer dependencies with the exact version `19.0.0-beta-26f2496093-20240514`.  
> Once React 19 has a stable release, Seia will be updated to support the stable version.

After installing Seia, you can optionally add the following commands to your `package.json`'s `scripts` section for convenience.

```json
"scripts": {
	"build": "seia build",
	"start": "seia start"
}
```

Then, you can follow the same steps as outlined in the [Quickstart Guide](#rocket-quickstart) to build the project and start the SSR server.

## :question: What is Server Components?

[React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) is a new concept first introduced in React 18 that allows you to render components on the server, but not on the client. What does that mean?

In traditional SSR architectures, the server renders the components and sends the HTML to the client. The client then re-renders the components and hydrates the HTML to make it interactive. This means your components run on both the server and the client, allowing you to access only the intersection of Node.js (or other runtimes) and web browser APIs.

With server components, you don't have to worry about this limitation. You can specify which components should be rendered on the server and which should be rendered on the client. This allows you to access the full Node.js API on the server and the full web browser API on the client, giving you the best of both worlds.

Imagine a simple example like this:

```tsx
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'

const FileContent = async ({ path }: { path: string }) => {
	const buffer = await readFile(path, 'utf-8')

	return <HtmlEscape>{buffer}</HtmlEscape>
}
```

We've created a basic file server with React!

The `FileContent` component reads a file from the file system on the server and returns its content as formatted HTML. We all know that reading server files from a browser is simply not possible! Therefore, the `FileContent` component should be a server component, ensuring that it will only render on the server.

Then, how do we specify that this component is a server component?

The answer is; we don't have to!

Every components are considered server components by default. If you want to specify that a component should be client component, you can simply write `"use client"` at the top of the file.

```tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

const Counter = () => {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

	return (
		<div>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
			<p>Count: {count}</p>
		</div>
	)
}
```

## :fire: Try Demo

You can try a simple demo of Seia with the [Blue Archive Students](./examples/blue-archive-students) sample. This project is a simple SSR application that fetches and displays the list of students of the [Blue Archive](https://bluearchive.nexon.com/home).

## :grey_question: What does the default port number `5314` mean?

The port number `5314` is a [L33T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) of "SEIA". This choice is inspired by [Vite using port 5173](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/8148).
